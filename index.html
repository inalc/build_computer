          <p>Welcome to Ina's Computer Shop. We build and repair computers.<br><br>

          <!--add another div of how may i help you etc -->

          Oh! You must be the new trainee. I heard that you're the only candidate who got 100% in our written test. You must be an expert!<br><br>

          By the way, my name's Matt: the best cat employee in this place and the best manager as of today. We've been in need of help ever since two of our employees disappeared...<br><br>

          Anyway, I'm so glad you're here! Let's start. </p><br>

          <button type="button" class="option" default-option" data-target="task-intro">- I'm ready!</button><br>
          <button type="button" class="option" default-option" data-target="no-test">- I don't remember taking a test...</button>
        </div>

        <div class="scene" id="no-test">
          <p>Really? Well, it doesn't matter. It's only a test of basic knowledge of computer hardware. I'm sure you have some kind of foundation. If not, well then I guess you'll learn a lot today! </p><br>

          <button type="button" class="option" data-target="task-intro">- I guess so!</button>
        </div>

        <div class="scene" id="task-intro">
          <p>As a newbie, I'll have you start out with computer components.<br><br>

          We get a lot of customers that want to build their own computer. You'll be in charge of finding the specific parts they need and explaining their purpose. You also have to clarify any questions and concerns they have.<br><br>

          Sounds easy, right? I'll be in the back doing repairs, but don't forget: I'm always watching. </p>
          <br>

          <button type="button" class="option" data-target="help-info">- Yes, sir.</button><br>
          <button type="button" class="option" data-target="help-info">- What if I need help?</button>
        </div>

        <div class="scene" id="help-info">
        <p>If you really need help, call me by pressing that red button by your side.<br><br>

        By the way, here's the inventory list. Most of everything's out here in the front, but let me know if we're missing anything and I'll find it for you. <br><br>

        Good luck!<br><p>

        <button type="button" class="option" data-target="transition">- Thank you!</button>
        </div>

        <div class="scene" id="transition">
          <p>Wow, my first day. I'm so nervous. I hope there are no customers today. And I wonder what happened to the previous employees?</p><br>
          <button type="button" class="option" data-target="customer1">*A small child walks in*</button>
        </div>

        <div class="scene" id="customer1">
          <p>Hello, my dad gave me this thing and told me to come here to have it replaced. He didn't tell me much, but he was trying to make my computer faster. Do you know what this is?
