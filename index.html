          <p>Welcome to Ina's Computer Shop. We build and repair computers.<br><br>

          Oh! You must be the new trainee. My name's Matt: the best cat employee in this place and the best manager as of today. We've been in need of help ever since two of our employees disappeared all of a sudden. I hired someone last week, but he only comes in part-time.<br><br>

          Anyway, I'm so glad you're here! Let's start. Do you have any background in computer hardware?</p><br>

          <button type="button" class="option" default-option" data-target="task-intro">- Honestly, no. But I'd love to learn!</button><br>
          <button type="button" class="option" default-option" data-target="no-test">- Sure, I use computers all the time! Mostly for memes.</button>
        </div>

        <div class="scene" id="no-test">
          <p>MReally? Well, it doesn't matter. It's only a test of basic knowledge of computer hardware. I'm sure you have some kind of foundation. If not, well then I guess you'll learn a lot today! </p><br>

          <button type="button" class="option" data-target="task-intro">- I guess so!</button>
        </div>

        <div class="scene" id="task-intro">
          <p>As a newbie, I'll have you start out with computer components.<br><br>

          We get a lot of customers that want to build their own computer. You'll be in charge of finding the specific parts they need and explaining their purpose. You also have to clarify any questions and concerns they have.<br><br>

          Sounds easy, right? I'll be in the back doing repairs, but don't forget: I'm always watching. </p>
          <br>

          <button type="button" class="option" data-target="help-info">- Yes, sir.</button><br>
          <button type="button" class="option" data-target="help-info">- What if I need help?</button>
        </div>

        <div class="scene" id="help-info">
        <p>I'll allow you to have three mistakes, but if you keep messing up then unfortunately, that's the end for you.<br><br>

        By the way, here's the inventory list. Most of everything's out here in the front, but let me know if we're missing anything and I'll find it for you. <br><br>

        Good luck!<br><p>

        <button type="button" class="option" data-target="transition">- Thank you!</button>
        </div>

        <div class="scene" id="transition">
          <p>Wow, my first day. I'm so nervous. I hope there are no customers today.<br><br>
          Maybe I should read up on computer basics online.</p><br>
          <button type="button" class="option" data-target="customer1">*A small child walks in*</button>
        </div>

        <div class="scene" id="customer1">
          <p>Hey Eli, I need help with-- Wait, where's Eli? He told me last week he'd be working everyday this week.</p><br>
          <button type="button" class="option" data-target="task-cpu">- I heard two employees are missing...</button><br>
          <button type="button" class="option" data-target="task-cpu">- I don't know anyone named Eli, but what do you need help in?</button>
        </div>

        <div class="scene" id="task-cpu">
          <p>Oh maybe he's on vacation. Anyway, I came by here the other day and got two 4GB RAM DDR-1600 and 525GB SSD. It made my computer pretty fast, but I figured I might as well upgrade my CPU too and my motherboard if necessary. Maybe a new power supply now that I think about it.
          </p><br>
          <button type="button" class="option" data-target="task-cpu">- Honestly, I'm new and I don't know what you're talking about. Could you explain some of the stuff you mentioned? </button><br>
          <button type="button" class="option" data-target="task-cpu">- Wow, sounds like you should just buy a brand-new computer!</button>
