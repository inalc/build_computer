          <p>Welcome to Ina's Computer Shop. We build and repair computers.<br><br>
          Oh! You must be the one I was on the phone with last night. Congratulations! You’re the first to apply and your training starts today.<br> <br>
          My name's Matt. I’m the best cat employee in this place and the only employee, actually. I’ve been in need of help ever since two of our employees disappeared all of a sudden. You heard about it, right?<br><br>
          </p>

          <button type="button" class="option" default-option" data-target="backstory">- What happened? </button><br>
          <button type="button" class="option" default-option" data-target="no-story">- Yes, it must have been devastating for you.</button>
        </div>

        <div class="scene" id="backstory">
          <p>Well we’ve been working for several months together -- me, Byrnes, and Haku. Everything was going well. Most of the days I stay in the back doing repairs while the two tend to the customers in the front of the shop, depending on their schedule. We were a solid team, you know? We even had dinner once a week and really got to know each other. <br><br>
          Until one day, I had to take a day off to pay my respects for my wife, Ina. You know, I built this shop for her a few weeks after she passed. It was one of her dreams to set up a neighborhood shop where people can get quality hardware locally and have weekly classes about computers and technology. I miss her very much...<br><br>
          Anyway, when I got back the next day everything was gone! The only remaining things are the stuff in the back since I’m the only one who has access to it. <br><br>
          </p>

          <button type="button" class="option" data-target="task-intro">- Wow, that’s unbelievable. Don’t worry I’ll help you as much as I can.</button>
        </div>

        <div class="scene" id="no-story">
          <p>Actually, I haven’t told anyone yet. So I’m not sure how you would’ve known. The incident only happened two days ago and the shop has been closed on days it would be regularly closed.<br><br>
          I guess it will be a bit harder for me to trust you…<br><br>
          </p>

          <button type="button" class="option" data-target="back-story">- I’m sorry, I just wanted to impress you. So what happened?</button><br>
          <button type="button" class="option" data-target="reason-for-test">- That’s not fair. You were testing me just now.</button>
        </div>

        <div class="scene" id="reason-for-test">
          <p>Of course, I have to test you! I have to be more picky about who I work with and who to entrust the shop with. It may be just an ordinary store to you, but for me it has a sentimental meaning I hold dearly in my heart. Now do you want to hear what happened?<br><br><p>

          <button type="button" class="option" data-target="backstory">- I’m sorry for being defensive. And yes, I’d like to hear the story, please.</button>
        </div>

        <div class="scene" id="task-intro">
          <p>Alright, then. First of all, I want to gauge how much you know about computer components. That’s fundamental with helping out customer concerns. Then, I’ll have you organize the inventory. The last step is actually interacting with the customers. Sounds fun, right? <br><br>
          I will be in the back doing repairs. But I recently installed cameras, so I’ll be watching and keeping score. I’ll share your score with you, so you know where to improve. <br><br>
          Let’s start!<br><br>
          </p>

          <button type="button" class="option" data-target="level1">- I'm ready</button>
